# Map_quiz
Straightforward, dynamic web application which uses Google Maps API to quiz users on CSUN campus locations.  Interaction with the app is entirely button-free -- the user progresses by double-clicking on the map.

This quiz app uses the jQuery library to simplify the code, including a final scoreboard animation.  Geographical data for the campus locations is stored as a JSON string.  CSS is embedded.

Take the CSUN campus quiz for a spin and see how you fare!
